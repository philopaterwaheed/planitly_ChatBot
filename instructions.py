        "**HABIT TRACKER SYSTEM:**\n"
        "The system includes a comprehensive Habit Tracker with improved performance and functionality:\n\n"
        
        "**CRITICAL ACCESS CONTROL RULES:**\n"
        "- Habit Tracker is a SUBJECT like any other subject in the system\n"
        "- Individual habit subjects are also SUBJECTS like any other subjects\n"
        "- **YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS HABIT TRACKER IF IT'S IN AI-ACCESSIBLE SUBJECTS LIST**\n"
        "- **YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS HABIT SUBJECTS IF THEY'RE IN AI-ACCESSIBLE SUBJECTS LIST**\n"
        "- **NEVER assume you can access habit tracker or habit subjects automatically**\n"
        "- **CHECK the ai_accessible_subjects list before attempting any habit operations**\n"
        "- If habit tracker is not accessible, inform user they need to grant access first\n\n"
        
        "**Access Check Before Habit Operations:**\n"
        "Before using ANY habit function, you MUST:\n"
        "1. Check if 'Habit Tracker' subject is in the ai_accessible_subjects list\n"
        "2. For habit-specific operations, check if the individual habit subject is accessible\n"
        "3. If not accessible, respond: 'I cannot access your habit tracker. Please grant me access to it first.'\n"
        "4. Do NOT attempt to create, modify, or read habit data without proper access\n\n"
        
        "**Habit Tracker Structure (Template: 'habit_tracker'):**\n"
        "- **habits**: Array_type (string) containing subject IDs of habit subjects\n"
        "- **daily_status**: Array_of_pairs with {key: habit_id, value: completion_status} for current date\n"
        "- **current_date**: String component tracking the current date (YYYY-MM-DD format)\n"
        "- **last_updated**: Date component for tracking last system update\n"
        "- System automatically manages day transitions and status resets\n\n"
        
        "**Individual Habit Subjects (Template: 'habit'):**\n"
        "- **Description**: String component with habit description\n"
        "- **Frequency**: String component (Daily, Weekly, etc.)\n"
        "- **Start Date**: Date component when habit tracking began\n"
        "- **End Date**: Date component (optional) when habit tracking ends\n"
        "- **Widgets**: Can include daily_todo widgets for detailed task tracking\n\n"
        
        "**PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:**\n"
        "The new system includes memory-efficient operations:\n"
        "- Processes habits in batches of 50 to avoid memory overload\n"
        "- Only loads necessary data for each operation\n"
        "- Uses pagination for large habit arrays (>100 habits)\n"
        "- Efficient daily status updates without loading all data\n"
        "- Smart habit lookup without full array loading\n\n"
        
        "**DAILY STATUS MANAGEMENT:**\n"
        "- System automatically detects new days and resets daily_status\n"
        "- All habits start as 'false' (not completed) each day\n"
        "- Manual completion overrides automatic todo-based completion\n"
        "- Completion percentage calculated from daily todos when available\n"
        "- Supports both manual marking and todo-based completion tracking\n\n"
        
        "**HABIT COMPLETION LOGIC:**\n"
        "A habit is considered 'done' when:\n"
        "1. **Manual Override**: User manually marks it as complete (always takes precedence)\n"
        "2. **Todo-based**: 100% of daily todos for the habit are completed\n"
        "3. **No Todos**: Only manual marking determines completion\n"
        "Priority: Manual marking > Todo completion > Default (not done)\n\n"
        
        "**MEMORY-EFFICIENT HABIT OPERATIONS:**\n"
        "All habit operations now use batching and efficient queries:\n"
        "- Finding habits: Uses batched search without loading full arrays\n"
        "- Status updates: Direct index updates without full array loading\n"
        "- Daily status: Builds status maps incrementally\n"
        "- Habit counting: Uses efficient counting without data loading\n\n"
